        <p>Pluto's History &amp; Naming</p>
        <p>Pluto is the only dwarf planet to once have been considered a major planet. Once thought of as the ninth planet and the one most distant from the sun, Pluto is now seen as one of the largest known members of the Kuiper Belt, a shadowy disk-like zone beyond the orbit of Neptune populated by a trillion or more comets. Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006, a change widely thought of as a demotion that has attracted controversy and debate.</p>

He predicted its location in 1915, but died without finding it. Its discovery came in 1930 from Clyde Tombaugh at the Lowell Observatory, based on predictions from Lowell and other astronomers.</p>
        <p>Pluto is the only world named by an 11-year-old girl, Venetia Burney of Oxford, England, who suggested to her grandfather that it get its name from the Roman god of the underworld. Her grandfather then passed the name on to Lowell Observatory. The name also honors Percival Lowell, whose initials are the first two letters of Pluto.</p>
        <p>Physical Characteristics of the Dwarf Planet Pluto</p>
        <p>Since Pluto is so far from Earth, little is known about the planet’s size or surface conditions. Pluto has an estimated diameter less than one-fifth that of Earth or only about two-thirds as wide as Earth's moon. The planets’ surface conditions probably consist of a rocky core surrounded by a mantle of water ice, with more exotic ices such as methane and nitrogen frost coating its surface.</p>
        <p>Pluto's orbit is highly eccentric, or far from circular, which means its distance from the sun can vary considerably and at times, Pluto’s orbit will take within the orbit of the planet Neptune. When Pluto is closer to the sun, its surface ices thaw and temporarily form a thin atmosphere, mostly of nitrogen, with some methane. Pluto's low gravity, which is a little more than one-twentieth that of Earth's, causes this atmosphere to extend much higher in altitude than Earth's. When traveling farther away from the Sun, most of Pluto's atmosphere is thought to freeze and all but disappear. Still, in the time that it does have an atmosphere, Pluto can apparently experience strong winds.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 10pt;color: #ffffff;">This is the most detailed view to date of the entire surface of the dwarf planet Pluto, as constructed from multiple NASA Hubble Space Telescope photographs taken from 2002 to 2003. The center disk (180 degrees) has a mysterious bright spot that is unusually rich in carbon monoxide frost. The image was released in February 2010. See the dwarf planet turn in a video based on these images.</p>

        <p>Pluto's surface is one of the coldest places in the solar system at roughly minus 375 degrees F (minus 225 degrees C). For a long time, astronomers knew little about its surface because of its distance from Earth, but more is coming, bit by bit, with the Hubble Space Telescope returning images of a planet that appears reddish, yellowish and grayish in places, with a curious bright spot near the equator that might be rich in carbon monoxide frost. When compared with past images, the Hubble pictures revealed that Pluto had apparently grown redder over time, apparently due to seasonal changes.</p>
        <p>Pluto's Orbital Characteristics</p>
        <p>Pluto's highly elliptical orbit can take it more than 49 times as far out from the sun as Earth. It actually gets closer to the sun than Neptune for 20 years out of Pluto's 248-Earth-years-long orbit, providing astronomers a rare chance to study this small, cold, distant world. So after 20 years as the 8th planet (in order going out from the sun), in 1999, Pluto crossed Neptune's orbit to become the farthest planet from the sun (until it was demoted to the status of dwarf planet).</p>
        <p>Composition &amp; Structure</p>
        <p>Atmospheric composition: Methane, nitrogen</p>
        <p>Magnetic Field: It remains unknown whether Pluto has a magnetic field, but its small size and slow rotation suggest it has little to none.</p>
        <p>Chemical composition: Probably a mixture of 70 percent rock and 30 percent water ice.</p>
        <p>Internal structure: Probably a rocky core surrounded by a mantle of water ice, with more exotic ices such as methane and nitrogen frost coating its surface.</p>

        <p>Orbit &amp; Rotation</p>
        <p>Average Distance from the Sun: 3,670,050,000 miles (5,906,380,000 km)</p>
        <p>By Comparison: 39.482 times that of Earth</p>
        <p>Perihelion (closest): 2,756,902,000 miles (4,436,820,000 km)</p>

        <p>Aphelion (farthest): 4,583,190,000 miles (7,375,930,000 km)</p>

        <p>Pluto's Moons</p>
        <p>In 1978, astronomers discovered Pluto had a very large moon nearly half its size, dubbed <MadCap:glossaryTerm>Charon</MadCap:glossaryTerm>, named for the mythological demon who ferried souls to the underworld in Greek mythology. <a href="../Resources/Images/Pluto-Moon-Charon (1).jpg">The huge size of Charon</a> sometimes leads scientists to refer to Pluto and Charon as a double dwarf planet or binary system.</p>
        <p>Pluto and Charon are just 12,200 miles (19,640 kilometers) apart, less than the distance by flight between London and Sydney. Charon's orbit around Pluto takes 6.4 Earth days, and one Pluto rotation — a Pluto day — also takes 6.4 Earth days. This is because Charon hovers over the same spot on Pluto's surface, and the same side of Charon always faces Pluto, a phenomenon known as tidal locking.</p>
        <p>While Pluto appears reddish, Charon seems grayish. Scientists suggest Pluto is covered with nitrogen and methane while Charon is covered with ordinary water ice.</p>
        <p>Compared with most of solar system's planets and moons, the Pluto-Charon system is tipped on its side in relation to the sun. Also, Pluto's rotation is retrograde compared to the other worlds — it spins backwards, from east to west.</p>
        <p>In 2005, as scientists photographed Pluto with the Hubble Space Telescope in preparation for the New Horizons mission — the first spacecraft to visit Pluto and the Kuiper Belt — they discovered two other tiny moons of Pluto, now dubbed Nix and Hydra. These are two to three times farther away from Pluto than Charon, and they are thought to be just 31 to 62 miles (50 to 100 kilometers) wide.</p>
        <p>Scientists using Hubble discovered a fourth moon in 2011. This moon is estimated to be 8 to 21 miles (13 to 34 km) in diameter. P4's orbit is between the orbits of Nix and Hydra. On July 11, 2012, a fifth moon was discovered.</p>
        <p>Research &amp; Exploration of the Dwarf Planet</p>
        <p>Pluto's distance from Earth has made it hard to see with telescopes and a daunting challenge to explore with spacecraft — NASA's New Horizons mission will be the first probe to study Pluto, its moons, and other worlds within the Kuiper Belt. It was launched on January 2006, making its closest approach to Pluto on July 2015, and carries some of the ashes of Pluto's discoverer, Clyde Tombaugh.</p>
        <p>Pluto's Formation &amp; Origins</p>
        <p>The leading theory for the formation of Pluto and Charon is that a nascent Pluto was struck with a glancing blow by another Pluto-sized object. Most of the combined matter became Pluto, while the rest spun off to become Charon.</p>
