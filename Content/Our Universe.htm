        <p class="margin" style="font-size: 18pt;"> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We know where our galaxy is located – but just locally speaking. The Milky Way galaxy is one of a few dozen galaxies known as the Local Group. Astronomers have discovered that our   <MadCap:glossaryTerm>Local Group</MadCap:glossaryTerm> is on the outskirts of a giant cluster of several thousand galaxies – which astronomers call the Virgo Cluster. But it’s only on this relatively small scale – the scale of tens of millions of light-years – that the universe appears clumpy. On a very large scale – a scale of billions of light-years – galaxies appear to be smoothly distributed across space. You could travel anywhere in the universe and, on a grand scale, space would look the same – a sea of galaxies.What’s more, to our knowledge, there’s no center of the universe – and no edge. As far as we know, the universe looks the same in all directions. So – beyond our Local Group and the  Virgo Cluster– it’s tough to describe our galaxy’s location relative to any special or fixed reference point in the universe.&#160;&#160;</p>
        <p style="font-size: 18pt;">.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In this guide, we will take a journey through the cosmos, exploring our own solar system, along with all the star clusters, galaxies, nebula’s, and super nova remnants that have been photographed by mankind.</p>
