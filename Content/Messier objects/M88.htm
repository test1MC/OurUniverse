        <p>Discovered 1781 by Charles Messier.</p>
        <p>Messier 88 (M88, NGC 4501) is one of the brighter spiral galaxies in the Virgo Cluster of Galaxies.</p>
        <p>M88 is one of the eight galaxies found on March 18, 1781 by Charles Messier in the Coma-Virgo region, and described by him as "nebula without stars," "one of the faintest" objects, and similar to M58. On that most successful discovery day, Messier also found <img src="../Resources/Images/m88ms_block_crop.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 502px;" usemap="#map1" title="Spiral galaxy in the constellation Coma Berenices" alt="M88" class="floatLeft" />globular cluster M92, to bring his daily score to 9 cataloged objects.</p>
        <p>M88 is among the first recognized as a spiral galaxy, and listed by Lord Rosse as one of 14 "spiral nebulae" discovered to 1850.</p>
        <p>This bright member of the <a href="file:///C:/Users/dspencer/Documents/My Projects/Our Universe/Content/Resources/Images/VirgocomaM.jpg" target="_self">Virgo Cluster of galaxies</a> is nicely symmetrical and of multiple-arm type. As its equatorial plane is inclined by about 30 degrees to the line of sight, its appearance resembles a bit that of the Andromeda galaxy M31, and its outline is an elongated ellipse of angular dimension between 7x4 to 8x3 arc minutes, according to different sources, corresponding to a linear diameter of about 130,000 light years. This is one of the more rewarding galaxies in the Virgo cluster for smaller instruments!</p>
        <p>This galaxy is one of the Virgo cluster members with a considerable peculiar velocity away from us, as it is receding with about 2000 km/sec.</p>
        <p>Type Ia Supernova 1999cl occurred in M88 on May 28, 1999, was discovered on May 29, 1999 at magnitude 16.4 and reached magnitude 13.6..13.8 (June 5, 1999).</p>
