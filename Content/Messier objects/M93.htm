        <p>Discovered by Charles Messier in 1781.</p>
        <p>Messier 93 (M93, NGC 2447) is a nice open star cluster in constellation Puppis.</p>
        <p>As one of the last deepsky objects found by him personally, open cluster M93 was discovered by Charles Messier and cataloged by him on March 20, 1781.</p>
        <p>M93 is one of the smaller but bright open clusters, the stars forming a triangular shape, while Kenneth Glyn Jones found it more like a butterfly, and Admiral Smyth was reminded to a star-fish. At least about 80 members appear scattered over its 22' apparent diameter, which is of the order of 20-25 light years linearly at its distance of about 3,600 light years.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The brightest stars of M93 are blue giants of type B9, its age has been estimated as roughly 100 million years. Its Trumpler classification is given as I,3,r.</p>
        <p>To find M93, find Omicron1 and Omicron2 CMa about 8 deg SE of Sirius, and M93 on the same parallel (declination) as Omicron2 but 10deg E, near Xi Puppis.</p>
