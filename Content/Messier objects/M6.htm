        <p style="font-size: 16pt;">This bright collection of about 80 stars are all moving through space together in The brightest star you see is a variable star, BM Scorpii, a yellow or orange supergiant that changes its magnitude between 5.5 and 7 with a semi-regular period. However, most of the stars here are hot, blue main sequence stars of spectral type B4-B5. </p>

Studies have been conducted on Messier 6′s upper main sequence stars for strong, highly structured magnetic fields – leading researchers further into understanding the origins and evolution of Ap stars in open clusters.an area spanning about 12 to 25 light years across – and may have formed anywhere from 51 to 95 million years ago. </p>
