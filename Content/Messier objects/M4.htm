            <MadCap:keyword term="M4" />M4</h1>
        <p>A globular cluster in the constellation of Scorpius. It was discovered by <MadCap:glossaryTerm>Philippe Loys de Chéseaux</MadCap:glossaryTerm> in 1746 and catalogued by Charles Messier in 1764. It was the first globular cluster in which individual stars were resolved.</p>
        <h2>Visibility</h2>
        <p>M4 is conspicuous in even the smallest of telescopes as a fuzzy ball of light. It appears about the same size as the Moon in the sky. It is one of the easiest globular clusters to find, being located only 1.3 degrees west of the bright star Antares, with both objects being visible in a wide field telescope. Modestly sized telescopes will begin to resolve individual stars of which the brightest in M4 are of apparent magnitude 10.8.</p>

        <h2>Characteristics</h2>
        <p>M4 is a rather loosely concentrated cluster of class IX and measures 75 light years across. It features a characteristic "bar" structure across its core, visible to moderate sized telescopes. The structure consists of 11th magnitude stars and is approximately 2.5' long and was first noted by William Herschel in 1783. At least 43 variable stars have been observed within M4.</p>
        <p>M4 is approximately 7,200 light years away, the same distance as NGC 6397, making these the two closest globular clusters to our Solar System. It has an estimated age of 12.2 billion years.</p>
        <p>In astronomy, the abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium is called the metallicity, and it is usually denoted by the abundance ratio of iron to hydrogen as compared to the Sun. </p>
