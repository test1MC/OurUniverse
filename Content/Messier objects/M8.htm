</MadCap:glossaryTerm></h1>
        <p style="font-size: 16pt;">The Lagoon Nebula (cataloged as Messier 8 or M8, and as NGC 6523) is a giant interstellar cloud in the constellation Sagittarius. It is classified as an emission nebula and as an H II region.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 16pt;">The Lagoon Nebula was discovered by <MadCap:glossaryTerm>Guillaume Le Gentil</MadCap:glossaryTerm> in 1747 and is one of only two star-forming nebulae faintly visible to the naked eye from mid-northern latitudes. Seen with binoculars, it appears as a distinct oval cloud-like patch with a definite core. A fragile star cluster appears superimposed on it.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 16pt;">

In the sky of Earth, it spans 90' by 40', translates to an actual dimension of 110 by 50 light years. Like many nebulae, it appears pink in time-exposure color photos but is gray to the eye peering through binoculars or a telescope, human vision having poor color sensitivity at low light levels. </p>
        <p style="font-size: 16pt;">The nebula contains a number of Bok globules (dark, collapsing clouds of protostellar material), the most prominent of which have been cataloged by E. E. Barnard as B88, B89 and B296. It also includes a funnel-like or tornado-like structure caused by a hot O-type star that emanates ultraviolet light, heating and ionizing gases on the surface of the nebula. The Lagoon Nebula also contains at its center a structure known as the Hourglass Nebula (so named by John Herschel), which should not be confused with the better known Hourglass Nebula in the constellation of Musca. In 2006 the first four Herbig-Haro objects were detected within the Hourglass, also including HH 870. This provides the first direct evidence of active star formation by accretion within it.</p>
