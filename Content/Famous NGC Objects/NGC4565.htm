        <p>This galaxy is ‘only’ 31 million light-years away and shines at a magnitude 9.6 in the constellation Coma Berenices. You too can see this galaxy because at that brightness it is well in the range of a small telescope or even binoculars and a dark sky.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Discovered in 1785 by William Herschel in 1785. It is not included in Charles Messiers catalog, probably because we are seeing it more or less edge-on. If we were able to see this full on it could possibly rival even Andromeda for brightness. Even in GALEX’s ultraviolet image we can see the galactic bulge at the center. SEDS has a nice optical image of this galaxy for comparison.</p>
